You always wanted a lover
I only wanted a job
I've always worked for my living
How'm I gonna get through?
How'm I gonna get through?

I come here looking for money
(Got to have it)
and end up leaving with love
Now you've left me with nothing
(Can't take it)
How'm I gonna get through?
How'm I gonna get through?

I bought you drinks, I brought you flowers
I read your books and talked for hours
Every day so many drinks
such pretty flowers, so tell me
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
What have I, what have I, what have Iâ€¦

Since you went away I've been hanging around
I've been wondering why I'm feeling down
You went away, it should make me feel better
but I don't know how I'm gonna get through
How I'm gonna get through

You always wanted me to be something I wasn't
You always wanted too much
Now I can do what I want to forever
How'm I gonna get through?
How'm I gonna get through?

At night, the people come and go
They talk too fast and walk too slow
Chasing time from hour to hour
I pour the drinks and crush the flowers
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
What have I, what have I, what have I...

Since you went away I've been hanging around
I've been wondering why I'm feeling down
You went away, it should make me feel better
but I don't know how I'm gonna get through
How I'm gonna get through

We don't have to fall apart, we don't have to fight
We don't need to go to hell and back every night
We could make a deal

What have I done to deserve this?
