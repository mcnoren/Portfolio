# My Theme Park Day

I created this app entirely on my own while I was a full time student. 
My Theme Park Day allows you to keep track of everything you do at a Theme Park. 
The app lets you easily track how long you spent waiting and how long you are at 
an attraction, show, or restaurant. You can add photos to the app and attach them 
to an event. My Theme Park Day automatically calculates stats about your day and 
appear in the summary. My Theme Park Day creates a pdf summarizing everything 
about your day including stats, photos, and notes for each event. This pdf can be 
shared with others or downloaded to your device.

### Features:
• Light / Dark mode

• PDF summary

• Park Presets

• Park Maps

• Works with any theme park

## Keep track of activities

The My Theme Park Day app is the perfect companion to your day at a theme park. 
The app lets you easily log when you started waiting, when you got on a ride, 
and when you got off a ride. You can also add notes and photos right in the app 
and attach them to an event.

## See a summary

Throughout your day, the My Theme Park Day app will calculate stats and show them 
in the summary page. Among these stats are how much time you saved in line with 
Lightning Lane, how accurate the posted wait times are, and much more!

## Share with others

At any time, you can generate a pdf of everything you did including all of your 
photos, notes, and stats for the day. You can share this pdf with your group for 
everyone to see.
